Purpose
=======
The f6-split-tool is a little helper tool to extract the exercise data in RAW 
data files from Polar F6 heartrate monitors on Linux. The RAW data can be 
captured by using the F6's SonicLink and the rs200-decoder tool by Jani Hursti. 
The split tool is neccessary to make the gathered data usable for SportsTracker
/ PolarViewer by Stefan Saring.
However, the f6-split-tool is only intended to be a transitional solution until
a more sophisticated tool is available. So stay tuned and check back regularly.

Usage
=====
First you need to transmit the data from your Polar F6 heartrate monitor to your
computer using the rs200-decode tool:

	$ rs200_decode -m -b -o dump.bin

After that, use the f6-split-tool to extract the exercises from the previously
gathered dump:

	$ f6-split-tool dump.bin

This will generate 12 individual files for each exercise. The files are called
"exercise_X.frd" where X is a number between 0 and 11. 0 is the most recent 
exercise whereas exercise 11 is the oldest in the watch's memory. The exercise 
files will also contain the total cumulative exercise duration as well as the 
cumulative calories burned (this is added by the f6-split-tool). The *.frd files
can then be imported into SportsTracker/PolarViewer.


Installation
============
Unpack the tarball and build the program using make. After that, the tool is 
ready to use.

	$ tar xf f6-split-tool-0.0.1.tar.gz
	$ cd f6-split-tool-0.0.1/
	$ make
