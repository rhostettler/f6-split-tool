Purpose
=======
The f6-split-tool is a little helper tool to extract the exercise data in RAW 
data files from Polar F6 and F11 heartrate monitors on Linux. The RAW data can 
be captured by using the F6's SonicLink and the rs200-decoder tool by Jani 
Hursti. The split tool is neccessary to make the gathered data usable for 
SportsTracker / PolarViewer by Stefan Saring.
However, the f6-split-tool is only intended to be a transitional solution until
a more sophisticated tool is available. So stay tuned and check back regularly.

Usage
=====
First you need to transmit the data from your Polar F6 heartrate monitor to your
computer using the rs200-decode tool:

	$ rs200_decode -m -b -o dump.bin

After that, use the f6-split-tool to extract the exercises from the previously
gathered dump:

	$ f6-split-tool <watch> dump.bin

where <watch> is either --f6 or --f11.

This will generate up to 12 individual files for each exercise. The files are 
called "exercise_X.frd" where X is a number between 0 and 11. 0 is the most 
recent exercise whereas exercise 11 is the oldest in the watch's memory. The 
exercise files will also contain the total cumulative exercise duration as well 
as the cumulative calories burned (this is added by the f6-split-tool). The 
*.frd files can then be imported into SportsTracker/PolarViewer.


Installation
============
See INSTALL for installation instructions.
